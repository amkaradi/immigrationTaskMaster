My intro project to React

What I want to build:
A website replica of the software that I already use at work:
-	Home page will have pie charts.
-	Link 1: Trackers; side panel will change to list all the tracker options.  Anyone can edit and modify changes in real time. (OnsiteFilingTracker attached to CheckTracker & LegalTracker)
  -If a case is being reviewed by legal it will not appear in the OnsiteFilingTracker.  
  -If case has no checks it will not be on the OnsiteFilingTracker
-	Link 2: Reports will be automatically mailed out at 12pm CST from all Trackers
-	Link 3: Create a Template for Official Letters, export them into PDF format and automatically save onto userâ€™s Dsktop.
